# Open Computational Design for Sustainable Development

## What is Open Computational Design?
Computational design is a systematic way of thinking about the design process and the use of computational technologies to support the design process {cite}`yu_computational_2021,johnson_design_2016`. Open computational design means that only open-source technologies and standards are used in the process, which allows the process to be readily extended to include new technologies as they emerge.
## Sustainable Development
Sustainable development is a direct reference to the <a href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals" target="_blank">17 United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDG)</a>.
## Why Open Computational Design?
Computational design offers new opportunities to design better built environment. Open computational design will use Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) and Free and Open Source Hardware (FOSH) for achieving sustainable developments. This will significantly reduce the cost of technology adoption in practice and especially in places that cannot afford expensive technologies. They are coincidentally located in the regions (e.g. Southeast Asia) where rapid urbanization is taking place.
