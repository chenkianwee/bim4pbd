# Cooling and Heating Loads
- **Space heat extraction rate** (space cooling load) - the rate at which thermal energy is removed from a space by terminal heat transfer devices. For radiant systems the sum of the convective and radiant heat transfer rates at the chilled surface. For all-air system, the sensible enthalpy difference between supply and return air flow.
- **Hydronic heat extraction rate** - the rate at which thermal energy is removed by the hyrdronic system. The enthalpy difference between supply and return chilled water flow. For radiant ceiling panels the hydronic extract rate will be similar to the space heat extraction rate. It will be different for high thermal mass radiant system like embedded surface and thermally activated building surface systems.
- **Internal heat gain rate** - the sum of convective and radiant heat gain from internal sources (lighting, people and equipments).
- **Solar heat gain rate** - the rate at which solar energy is transmitted through glazing into the interior space.
- **Envelope heat transfer rate** - the net sum of convective and radiant heat transfer rates at the interior surface of the envelope.
