# Radiant Heat Transfer: Reflectance, Absorptance and Emittance

- **Reflectance $\rho$**: decimal fraction indicating how much of the incident radiation is reflected by a surface.
- **Absorptance $\alpha$**: decimal fraction, a measure of the ability to absorb radiation, relative to the perfect black body where the absorptance is 1. 
  - **For any opaque surfaces reflectance + absorptance = 1**. 
  - Absortance is high for dark surface and low for light/shiny metallic surfaces. e.g. 0.9 for black asphalt, 0.2 for shiny aluminium.
- **emittance $\epsilon$**: decimal fraction, a measure of the ability to emit radiation, relative to the ‘black body’, the perfect emitter.
  - **For ordinary surfaces emittance = absorptance** for the same wavelength (temperature) of radiation. However many surfaces have selective properties. For example: 
  - it is desireable for solar collectors to have high absorptance for solar (6000C), but low emittance at ordinary temperatures (<100c).
  - it is desireable for skyview passive cooling to have low absorptance for solar (6000C), but high emittance at ordinary temperatures (<100c).
  - A shiny metal surface is non-selective meaning emittance = absorptance.
