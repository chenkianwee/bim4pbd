# Open Computational Design for Sustainable Development

## What is Open Computational Design?
Computational design uses computational technologies to support and enhance the design process. It requires designers to think about the design process in a systematic way so as to effectively apply appropriate technologies during the process {cite}`yu_computational_2021,johnson_design_2016`. Computational design offers new opportunities to design better built environment. It promises a seamless built-virtual-built cycle where designers are able to design virtually, translate the design to built artefact using digital fabrications, then again capture and represent the artefact virtually with sensors and reality capture technologies for refinement. This cycle allows designers to refine their designs relatively cheap and rapid. **It is a powerful tool for designers to design a sustainable future**.

An open computational design uses only Free and Open Source Software (FOSS), Free and Open Source Hardware (FOSH)) and open standards in the process, which allows the process to be shared and readily extended to include new technologies as they emerge.

## Why Open Computational Design?
Open computational design will significantly reduce the cost of technology adoption in practice and especially in places that cannot afford expensive technologies. They are coincidentally located in the regions where rapid urbanization is taking place (e.g. Southeast Asia). I hope to encourage designers to share their design process openly for others to build upon. As new improvements are made, the industry and society stands to gain as we improve the way we design our built environment. This is only possible with the use of open-source technologies where everyone can contribute and modify the computational design process to suit their own needs.

Computational design process that uses proprietary technologies deters access for designers that cannot afford the technologies and prevent open sharing. For example, I have developed and openly shared an optimization routine in a proprietary CAD system called CADx. If DesignersX who uses CADy for their projects are interested in using the process. They need to buy CADx. Import the CADy file into CADx (provided the two CAD systems interoperate), learn a new software suite and run the routine. Modify and improve on the routine and contribute back to the source.

This is currently the dominant practice in computational design. Computational designers are converging to a few proprietary software packages, as a result many of the openly shared computational design process are not truly open. Middleware libraries (e.g. <a href="https://speckle.systems/" target="_blank">speckle</a> and <a href="https://compas.dev/index.html" target="_blank">COMPAS</a>) are popular solutions to enable interoperability between these software packages. The middleware links the packages together to perform different tasks. The packages linked are primarily proprietary with a small mix of open-source packages. I can foresee as the task gets more complex, the process will require the use of more software. A few issues will arise with this current trend:

1. The middleware will have to accommodate ever more software. This creates a fragile software ecosystem, where one software package can easily break the whole process by accident through a routine software/API update.
2. Designers will be required to purchase multiple software licenses just to perform a particular task. The cost will limit the adoption of the computational design in practice and prohibit it in developing regions.
3. The industry will be lock-in to a few technology vendors.

Open computational design is a response to the current situation. I recommend the use of open source technologies and open standards when sharing their design process. I hope to facilitate this through:

1. Improving computational literacy of designers so that they are capable of developing computational design process with open-source technologies and standards.
2. Development of open computational design technologies that facilitates the computational design process.
3. Develop and distribute open computational design process that supports the design of sustainable development.

This E-book serves to document my effort to contribute to open computational design.
